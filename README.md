## Circos-Project
### An implementation of circos for Genomics

[Circos](http://www.circos.ca) is a software package for visualizing data and information. It visualizes the data in a circular design, which makes circos ideal for exploring relationships between objects or positions. It is ideal for creating high quality data and illustrations with high data rates In ink, layered data pleasant symmetries. Circos is flexible. Although originally designed to visualize genomic data, you can create figures from data in any field, from genomics to visualization of mathematical art migration. Circos can be automated. It is controlled by plain text configuration files, which makes it difficult to configure and difficult to manipulate for an end user.
